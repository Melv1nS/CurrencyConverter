# CurrencyConverter

A Currency Conversion app built using React Native! This was part of a React Native course by Spencer Carli and my first forray into React Native.

To run it you need expo installed and a few other react native dependencies such as react navigation.
You also need the expo app on your phone. 

Once you have those installed you can type npm start in the program directory and then scan the qr code on your phone. This will then open the project in the expo app on your phone.
